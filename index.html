    <h1>Fuck Starlink üñïüõ∞Ô∏è</h1>

    <h2>Why this initiative?</h2>

    <p>It seems that you accessed this website using Starlink or a similar mega-constellation network or that you are interested to know why the harm they are doing to our society and environment is bigger than the service they are giving to a few.</p>

    <p>We are not supporting the deployment of those mega-constellations to access the Internet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Because they are creating a huge amount of debris in space: <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/wastex-environmental-harms-of-satellite-internet-mega-constellations/">WasteX
            Environmental harms of satellite internet mega-constellations - Lucas Rockett Gutterman, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, August 8, 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because the reentry from low-Earth orbit generates aluminum oxide nanoparticles that can cause significant ozone depletion on the long-term: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109280">Potential Ozone Depletion From Satellite Demise During Atmospheric Reentry in the Era of Mega-Constellations Jos√© P. Ferreira, Ziyu Huang, Ken-ichi Nomura, Joseph Wang, 11 June 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because they are causing serious impact on the observation of space: <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa37501-20/aa37501-20.html">Impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations with ESO telescopes in the visible and infrared domains, Olivier R. Hainaut and Andrew P. Williams, 27 February 2020</a></li>
        <li>To be completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our environnement, our climate and our sky is a common good that is too precious to be privatized to bring Internet acces for a few priviledges humans.</p>

    <h2>I am using Starlink for [reasons] and I still want to have access to those blocked websites</h2>

    <p>Use a VPN.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>All the private companies running those mega-constellations own a few blocks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP (v4 and v6)</a> ranges, we are simply blocking those IPs and redirecting them to this website.</p>

    <h2>I want to support the initiative</h2>

    <p>You can contribute to the project on <a href="https://github.com/edhelas/fuckstarlink">Github</a> by improving the blocked IP lists or find new way to apply this list on services.</p>

    <h2>How do I block Starlink & co myself?</h2>

    <img src="img/mypart.webp">

    <h3>I host websites on nginx</h3>

    <p>Put the IP blocks file in your <code>/etc/nginx/conf.d/</code> directory.</p>
    <p>Add the following code snippet to all the websites you want to block:</p>

    <pre>
server {
    ...

    if ($starlink_user) {
        rewrite ^ https://movim.eu/fuckstarlink;
    }

    ...
}
    </pre>

    <p>To be completed with other services...</p>
