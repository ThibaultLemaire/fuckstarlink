    <h1>Fuck Starlink üñïüõ∞Ô∏è</h1>

    <p>It seems that you accessed this website using Starlink or a similar mega-constellation network.</p>

    <p>We are not supporting the deployment of those mega-constellations to access the Internet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Because they are creating a huge amount of debris in space: <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/wastex-environmental-harms-of-satellite-internet-mega-constellations/">WasteX
            Environmental harms of satellite internet mega-constellations - Lucas Rockett Gutterman, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, August 8, 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because the reentry from low-Earth orbit generates aluminum oxide nanoparticles that can cause significant ozone depletion on the long-term: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109280">Potential Ozone Depletion From Satellite Demise During Atmospheric Reentry in the Era of Mega-Constellations Jos√© P. Ferreira, Ziyu Huang, Ken-ichi Nomura, Joseph Wang, 11 June 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because they are causing serious impact on the observation of space: <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa37501-20/aa37501-20.html">Impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations with ESO telescopes in the visible and infrared domains, Olivier R. Hainaut and Andrew P. Williams, 27 February 2020</a></li>
        <li>To be completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our environnement, our climate and our sky is a common good that is too precious to be privatized to bring Internet acces for a few priviledges humans.</p>
